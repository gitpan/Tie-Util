Tie::Util, version 0.03 (beta)

This module provides a few subroutines for examining and modifying
tied variables,  including those that hold weak references to  the
objects to which they are tied,  and variables tied to packages as
opposed to objects.


RECENT CHANGES

0.03
----
Bug fix:  Suppress ‘Ambiguous use’ warnings introduced in perl 5.13.3.

0.02
----
Incompatible change:
• is_weak_tie now returns false for a variable tied to undef, because
  the tie does not actually hold a weak reference; it holds no refe-
  rence at all.
New features:
• Added support for tying to a package (or anything else)
• Added a ‘tied’ function that returns the actual scalar the tie uses.
Bug fixes:
• Tying $@ no longer makes is_tied die.
• weak_tie now returns the same scalar that holds the tie, the way
 ‘tie’ does.
