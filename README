Tie::Util, version 0.01 (beta)

This module provides a few subroutines for examining and modifying
tied variables,  including those that hold weak references to  the
objects to which they are tied.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install Tie::Util"
